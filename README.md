----------- BELOW IS JUST AN EXAMPLE -------------






```
The social network application enables a user to:
- invoke the application THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list


GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client server folder structure
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
WHEN I register a service worker
THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
WHEN I deploy to Heroku
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application


* Satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria plus the following:

  * Uses IndexedDB to create an object store and includes both GET and PUT methods

  * The application works without an internet connection

  * Automatically saves content inside the text editor when the DOM window is unfocused

  * Bundled with webpack

  * Create a service worker with workbox that Caches static assets

  * The application should use babel in order to use async / await

  * Application must have a generated `manifest.json` using the `WebpackPwaManifest` plug-in

  * Can be installed as a Progressive Web Application
```

## Heroku Link
[Heroku Link](https://pwaeditor.herokuapp.com/) 

```
PWAeditor:
* is deployed to Heroku at live URL with build scripts
* loads with no errors
* user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate
* user interface style is clean and polished
* resembles the mock-up functionality provided in the Challenge instructions
```
